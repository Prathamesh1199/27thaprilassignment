The algorithm works by iteratively assigning \ndata points to the nearest cluster center (centroid) based on their distance, and then recalculating the centroids\nfor each cluster.\nThe K-means algorithm consists of the following steps:\n1. Randomly choose k initial centroids.\n2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n3. Recalculate the centroids for each cluster.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence, i.e., the centroids no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.   ",

It requires the user to specify the number of clusters, \nwhich can be difficult to determine. It also assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized, which may \nnot be true for all datasets.
